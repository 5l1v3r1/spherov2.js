# Sphero API V2

Work in progress. Some commands are functional but not ready for prime time.


### Examples

First run this:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:igbopie/spherov2.js.git
cd sphero2.js
yarn install
```

then:

* `yarn hid`: Steelseries Nimbus + Sphero Mini
* `yarn cmd`: CMD interaction with Sphero Mini
* `yarn patrol`: Will move in a square (for now).
* `yarn police`: Will turn on LED as police do.
* `yarn collision`: Will turn red when collision detected
